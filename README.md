This repository contains annual SAMHSA project program evaluation report files for [Right Start for Colorado](https://www.wellpower.org/right-start-colorado/), a project of WellPower (formerly the Mental Health Center of Denver). 
I served as the inagural program evaluator for this 5-year grant project for the first 27 months of the program, October 2018 through December 2020. During this time, I desgined the evaluation plan including developing all data collection tools, data analysis processes, and reporting mechanisms. I then trained the new program evaluator while I transitioned to a new role. 

This project relied upon the following tools and technologies:  
- R Studio Server
- SQL Server Management Studio 
- Microsoft PowerApps
- Constant Contact
- Qualtrics
- The WellPower Electronic Health Record, Avatar
- Tableau
